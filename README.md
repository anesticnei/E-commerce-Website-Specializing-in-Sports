# E-commerce Website Specializing in Sports

I created an e-commerce website specializing in sports, gym, and lifestyle wear. This non-commercial project allowed customers to browse products, add items to their cart, and purchase them.

The website included features such as a product search bar, categorized product sections, and a shopping cart that saved its contents in the browser's local storage.

Additionally, the website supported a dark mode theme that could be toggled on or off by the user, with the theme preference also saved in the browser's local storage.

My main focus during the development of this project was on mobile devices, ensuring that the website was optimized for smaller screens and touch input.
